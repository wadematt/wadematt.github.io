The compromise_README.md is the README.md included in the compromise NLP library github repo. I included this to improve AI agents' ability to use compromise.min.js properly.

Similarly, the compromise_tag.htm is the HTML of a site that discusses the tags available in the compromise library which I included for the same reason.
